# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various bit manipulation techniques and operations.

## Description

Bit manipulation is an essential concept in computer programming and embedded systems. It involves manipulating individual bits within a binary representation of data. This repository explores different bit manipulation techniques and provides examples of their use in C.

## List of Programs

1. **0-binary_to_uint.c**: Converts a binary string to an unsigned integer.
2. **1-print_binary.c**: Prints the binary representation of an unsigned integer.
3. **2-get_bit.c**: Retrieves the value of a bit at a specific index.
4. **3-set_bit.c**: Sets the value of a bit at a specific index to 1.
5. **4-clear_bit.c**: Sets the value of a bit at a specific index to 0.
6. **5-flip_bits.c**: Calculates the number of bits needed to flip to convert one number to another.
7. **100-get_endianness.c**: Determines the endianness of the system.
8. **101-password**: A script that generates random passwords with specific requirements.

## Getting Started

To compile these programs, you can use a C compiler like `gcc`. For example:

```shell
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-binary_to_uint.c -o binary_to_uint
```

To run a program, use:

```shell
./binary_to_uint
```

Replace `0-binary_to_uint.c` and `binary_to_uint` with the relevant program and output file names.

## Usage

Each program can be run independently and serves a specific purpose related to bit manipulation. Refer to the program's description and comments within the code for usage details.
